"Cabinetron" - Last assignment from 4743 Applied Software Engineering.

# Disclaimer
I've decided to upload this Assignment to my GitHub because I realized I don't have any projects written in Java up right now.
The reason it wasn't up to begin with was because I had some hesitation about putting up a representation of my work
that I wasn't able to dedicate a lot of time or effort to.

# About
This project is an enterprise application written in Java that has an interface built in Swing. It is supposed to represent a
hypothetical business our professor referred to as "Cabinetron" that manufactured and shipped Cabinets and their parts.

# Important
As it is built right now it is not possible to clone/download this project and run it on your machine.  The database server was
hosted by our professor and that is no longer up, and the application currently will not open if the database connection is not
successfully established.
